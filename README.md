TP----the number of true sample to predict as true   (true positive)  
FN----the number of true sample to predict as false  (false negative)   
FP----the number of false sample to predict as true  (false positive)   
TN----the number of false sample to predict as false (true negative)

Precision     P=TP/(TP+FP)   
recall        R=TP/(TP+FN)   
F1            F1=2TP/(2TP+FP+FN)   2/F1=1/P+1/R   
accuracy      A=(TP+TN)/(TP+FN+FP+TN)
